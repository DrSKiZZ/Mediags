* `ConDiags` - The console front-end branded as Mediags.
* `ConFlac` - The console front-end branded as UberFLAC.

* `FlacModel400` - The domain compiled for test and development only.
* `Install` - Builds `UperApps.msi` installer for all tools.
* `Source` - All the "business" logic of file formats organized into shared libraries.
* `Test400` - A woefully short set of unit tests. Code coverage is abysmal.
