## Repository layout

This repository is organized as a single Visual Studio solution with additional documentation files in the root.
These are the folders:

* `Bench` - Code generation and benchmarking folder of projects.
* `Source` - All the "business" logic of file formats organized into shared libraries.
* `FlacModel400` - The domain compiled for test and development only.
* `ConDiags` - The console front-end branded as Mediags.
* `ConFlac` - The console front-end branded as UberFLAC.
* `ConLame` - The console front-end branded as UberLAME.
* `WpfFlac` - GUI front-end of UberFLAC.
* `Test400` - A woefully short set of unit tests. Code coverage is abysmal.
